# Vynce — Integration & Fixes Documentation

This `docs/` folder summarizes the integration work done to merge the `vynce-social-frontend-code` into the main `vynce` launcher app, the fixes performed, build/run instructions, findings, and recommended next steps.

Files in this folder:
- `CHANGES.md` — concise list of actions performed
- `FIXES.md` — details about each issue found and how it was fixed
- `BUILD.md` — developer steps to install, run dev, and build production
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — high-level platform recommendation (Eco + Apps, staged)
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` — engineering next steps and priorities

If anything in the codebase was unintentionally modified that impacts UI, revert it and tell the team; this documentation only describes integration and non-UI fixes.
